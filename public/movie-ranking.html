<h1>The Best Movies According to Cassie</h1>
<h2>My top 3 favorite movies</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom</h3>
<p>I chose this movie becaues it is a well rounded movie, it has some action, comedy
and romance. There was lots of parts that would just make you laugh they did good with
keeping you on your feet while still keeping it light at times to bring the mood back up.</p>
<h3>The Fast and the Furious</h3>
<p>I liked this one because I am a fan of fast cars and I liked this movie because it
still had a good amount of action in it but it was also the one that actually had more 
to do with cars and racing.</p>
<h3>Ticket to Paradise</h3>
<p>I liked this one because it was a good comedy and romance movie that was a good. It
did not have anything to crazy and I would say a more family friendly movie. I am not 
big with a lot of romance or comedy movies but this one was well done.</p>
