<h1>A Little About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Cassandra Bingham. I have graduated from Salt Lake Community College with an AS Degree in Graphic 
  Communications. Some fun things about me are I have an older Jeep, that I have enjoyed working on and taking off roading
  with my husband. I love being in the outdoors, hiking, camping and like I mentioned before off roading. I enjoy photography
  especially nature photography. I come from a small family and I got married which has brought me some fun adventures. I like 
  learning new techniques with some of the Adobe programs and testing my skills as well as expanding my horizon's on what I 
  can do. I am also learning how do do web design as well and I am having fun learning a lot of new things.
